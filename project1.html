	<h1>User Research</h1>
	<p>My intital steps before implementation</p>
</div>

<!-- USER INTERVIEWS -->
<div class="row">
	<div id= userinterviews>
		<h1>User Interviews</h1>
		<div class="col-md-4">

			<p>I really enjoyed the user interviews because it gave me a chance to understand and find any insights that I needed to piece together. It was an intital step to understanding the my users. I interviewed a hiring manager, a developer, and a fellow UX designer. I was able to gain insight on how these different roles view a portfolio and what matters to them most. However, I do wish that I interviewed more people to gain a broader understanding.

<!-- COMPETITOR ANALYSIS-->
<div class="row">
	<div id=companalysis>
		<h1>Competitor Analysis</h1>
		<div class= "col-md-4"> 
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LFgF2445HVBzLzQ456AOZQPGi8RQJ5FATZeTCrpOZt8/edit?usp=sharing">
				<img src="competitoranalysis.jpg" height =150px width=150px>
			</a>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
			Completing the competitor analysis was a little more difficult as I wasn't sure who my actual competitors were since I was creating a portfolio from scratch. I understood that my basic competitors were other new grads looking for a job in UX Design. However, I branched out from direct competitors and now into indirect competitors. These indirect competitors became third party websites that featured other junior UX Designers. With the competitor analysis, I was able to determine what common features that they used such as core portfolio work, contact information, and bio. I intended to use my portfolio website as supoorting information as I wanted to put my work on these competitor websites as well.

<!-- FEATURE VALUE MATRIX -->
<div class="row"> 
	<div id=fvmatrix> 
		<h1>Feature Value Matrix</h1>
		<div class="col-md-4"> 
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ctPO64qbSV9KXd1w4WXo9I-qedLyakpgkXHdGclFaoI/edit?usp=sharing"> 
				<img src="fvmatrix.jpg" height=150px width=150px>
			</a>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6"> 
			<p>
			For my future value matrix, I included some basic features based on the insight that I got from my competitor analysis and the user interviews. Some basic features that I needed to include were an 'About' section, a 'Contact' section, and a description of myself and skills. After gathering information from my competitor analysis, I knew what basic features that I wanted to include. However, later in implementation I found that my portfolio work did not represent what I wanted to include or I did not know how to code it.

<!-- FEATURE PRIORITIZATION-->
<div class="row">
	<div id=fprior> 
		<h1>Feature Prioritization</h1>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tmsZhACRPJ4weMm5UMMBPJQ9xVxrwg_BQUkIE_rUkAk/edit?usp=sharing">
				<img src="featureprior.jpg" height=150px width=150px>
			</a>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
			The feature prioritization was an extension of my feature value matrix. I think I could have done without the feature prioritization since I already created an feature value matrix. If I could redo this step, I would go back and focus more on my feature value matrix so that I could actually create a well-rounded feature prioritization.

<div class="jumbotron text-center">
	<h1>User Testing</h1>
	<p>After implementation, I went back to test my portfolio</p>
</div>

<!-- USER STORIES -->
<div class="row">
	<div id=userstories>
		<h1>User Stories</h1>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1Kk_b5mdYo01ZtqSGw6k8lbhKeOcg7XzVTUDcYhAsCOA/edit?usp=sharing">
				<img src="userstories.jpg" height=150px width=150px>
			</a>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
				User stories were a great way to have a more focused conversation with my participants/users. I was able to see their persepctive as a hiring manager, fellow designer, etc. I focused on features that were already existed on my website and features that I knew i wanted to include (skills section, portfolio section, etc). This was the first step of my user testing and due to limited time, I was going into this step unhappy with my website. There were things that I wanted to include but I was unable to develop it in a short period of time. However, with this step I was able to gain a direct sense of what features were the most important. In the user interviews, I was reading inbetween the lines of what features were needed, but with the user storeis I gained a deeper understanding of what my users are looking for. For example, my users understood that it was a portfolio website, but they couldn't find my skills. I had included my skills in my bio (which I thought was enough), but now I plan on including a direct skill section to highlight this weak point.

<!-- COGNTITIVE WALKTHROUGH -->
<div class ="row">
	<div id=cogwalks>
		<h1>Cognitive Walkthroughs</h1>
		<div class= "col-md-4"> 
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/uci.edu/spreadsheets/d/1mICGNrimFyS7ocm4NbUZxYcDox6kHXGUIPz2L--UnG8/edit?usp=sharing">
				<img src="cogwalks.jpg" height=150px width=150px> 
			</a>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p>
				Of all the tests that I conducted I found that the cognitive walkthroughs were the most helpful. I was able to sit down with the user and see what their thoughts and processes were as they navigated the website. It was this qualitative research that really helped me grasp what was missing from my website and what needed improvement. From the cognitive walkthroughs, I found out that my 'scrollify' feature was well-liked but did not assist the need for basic navigation. Also, I found out that my users thought my website was a bit disorganized (which I knew already) and that they liked a simpler aesthetic.

<!-- USER TESTS -->
<div class="row">
	<div id="usertests">
		<h1>User Tests</h1>

		<div class="col-md-6"> 
			<p>
			While the user tests were easy to set up, I found that this was useful only to see another aspect of how the user interacts with my website visually. The user tests were limited as I would only receive a few words as feedback when I expected a more in-depth answer. I would use this again in the future, but frame my questions in a way that yielded a more detailed answer. Since I was new to usabilityhub.com, I wasn't exactly sure how to fully take advantage of the platform. Also, at this point I had already done my cognitive walkthroughs and user stories, so I predicted that my users would have trouble with navigation - which was exactly the case. I plan on using this platform again after I implement the feedback that my users gave me.

	<h1>What next?</h1>
		<div id="what_next">
			<p>
			My website is not done yet as there are things that I know needs improvement like my portfolio section and overall navigation. I include a direct skills section that highlighted my skills with coding and design. I also put my bio next to my picture as I thought this looked more cohesive. I included navigation tabs that I attend to use with scrollify (but I am having some bug issues) and changed my color scheme to something much more simple so that it does not take away from my overall message. I plan on perfecting the responsive design so that it matches my aeshetic goals and adding my work and fixing the navigation. As a new UX designer I don't have any recent projects that I like to showcase at the moment.

	<h1>Reflection</h1>
	<div id=reflection>
		<p>I enjoyed this project as I really was able to understand the importantce of the user research process and how the user research really does help the implementation process. This was my first time going through the whole user research part, implementing my findings, and then testing it. The hardest part was creating the connect between my code and my design. There were things that I wanted to do but I did not know how to code it.
